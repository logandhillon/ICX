## Installation

You will need:
- Java 21 or newer

Steps:
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/logandhillon/ICX/releases) and extract the files
2. Launch the `ICX` (or `ICX.bat` on Windows) program 
3. Get chatting!

## How does it work?

### Chatters

Launch the ICX program normally, enter your screen name, the server address, and get chatting!

### Servers

Launch the ICX program with the `-s` (or `--server`) flag, share your IP, and now ICX clients can connect!

For firewalls, port forwarding, etc. you will need to allow TCP traffic on port 195.
